                            TrySpeak is the AI business manager built for Leeds tradespeople, restaurants, and small businesses. 
                            Not just an answering service - a complete business manager that handles customer calls, schedules your diary, 
                            triages emergencies, and grows your business while you focus on doing the work you're brilliant at.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-white-75 mb-3" style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
                            Stop losing customers to voicemail. Stop juggling phones on job sites. Stop choosing between answering calls 
                            and finishing the job in front of you. Your AI manager handles every customer call professionally, books appointments 
                            into your calendar, and texts you only when it's urgent. It's like having a £30k/year office manager for £75/month.

                        <p class="text-white-75 mb-4" style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
                            Setup in 5 minutes through one phone call. No typing, no software, no technical nonsense. Just talk to our AI 
                            about your business, and within 2 hours you have a custom AI manager trained specifically for YOUR trade - 
                            speaking with a British accent your customers trust.

                <p class="text-white text-center mb-5" style="font-size: 1.1rem; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto 3rem;">
                    TrySpeak is designed to be the easiest AI receptionist service for tradespeople and small business owners. 
                    We've eliminated all the technical complexity so you can focus on what you do best - running your business. 
                    Here's exactly how it works from start to finish:
                </p>
                <div class="row text-white-75 mt-5">
                    <div class="col-md-3 mb-4">

                        <h4 class="text-white text-center">1. Talk to Our Setup AI (5 Minutes)</h4>
                        <p>After signing up, you'll receive an SMS with a phone number to call. Our onboarding AI will have a natural conversation 
                        with you about your business. Tell us what services you offer, your working hours, how you handle emergencies, your pricing, 
                        and areas you cover. For example: "I'm a plumber in Leeds, I do emergency repairs, boiler installations, and bathroom refits. 
                        I work Monday to Friday 8am-6pm, with emergency callouts available. A burst pipe is an emergency, a dripping tap can wait."</p>
                        <p>The AI asks follow-up questions to understand your business properly - just like you'd brief a new receptionist. 
                        This 20-30 minute conversation is recorded and becomes the blueprint for your custom AI receptionist.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-3 mb-4">

                        <h4 class="text-white text-center">2. We Build Your Custom AI (2 Hours)</h4>
                        <p>Our team reviews your onboarding call and builds a custom AI receptionist trained specifically for your business. 
                        This isn't a generic bot - it knows your services, pricing, working hours, and how to handle different types of calls 
                        for YOUR trade or business type.</p>
                        <p>The AI is programmed to detect emergencies based on what you told us (burst pipes, electrical faults, restaurant food 
                        safety issues), knows when to take detailed booking information, and understands when to simply take a message. 
                        Within 2 hours, your AI is ready and you'll receive an SMS with your new phone number.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-3 mb-4">

                        <h4 class="text-white text-center">3. Forward Your Calls</h4>
                        <p>Set up call forwarding on your mobile or business line to redirect calls to your new TrySpeak number. This takes 2 minutes 
                        and works with any UK mobile network. You can forward all calls, or only when you're busy or out of hours.</p>
                        <p>If you want to keep your existing business number visible to customers (so they don't see a different number), 
                        we offer number porting for an additional £20/month. Otherwise, simply give customers your new TrySpeak number - 
                        it's a proper UK phone number that looks professional.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-3 mb-4">
                        <i class="bi-check-circle-fill fs-1 mb-3 d-block text-center"></i>
                        <h4 class="text-white text-center">4. Your AI Answers Every Call</h4>
                        <p>From this moment on, your AI receptionist answers every call professionally with a British accent. Customers hear: 
                        "Good morning, you've reached [Your Business]. How can I help you today?" The AI handles the conversation naturally, 
                        books appointments, takes detailed messages, and immediately texts you for emergencies.</p>
                        <p>Every call is recorded and transcribed. You can listen to recordings, read transcripts, and see all your bookings 
                        in your TrySpeak dashboard. Control everything via voice commands in our mobile app - perfect when you're on job sites 
                        with dirty hands.</p>

                <h2 class="text-center mt-0">Why Leeds Tradespeople Choose TrySpeak Over Traditional Answering Services</h2>
                <hr class="divider" />
                <p class="text-center text-muted mb-5" style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto 3rem; font-size: 1.1rem;">
                    TrySpeak isn't just another answering service. We've built something specifically for British tradespeople and small business 
                    owners who need a receptionist that actually understands their business. Here's what makes us different:
                </p>
                <div class="row mt-5">
                    <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 mb-5">
                        <div class="text-center"><i class="bi-mic-fill fs-1 text-primary mb-3 d-block"></i></div>
                        <h3 class="h4 mb-3 text-center">Voice Onboarding & Voice Control - No Typing Required</h3>
                        <p class="text-muted">Tradespeople don't have time to sit at a computer filling in forms or typing on tiny phone keyboards 
                        on dusty job sites. TrySpeak lets you set up and manage everything by talking. Our voice-controlled mobile app means you 
                        can check today's bookings, listen to call recordings, or update your availability - all hands-free while you're working.</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">This is especially valuable for plumbers, electricians, and builders who are constantly on-site. 
                        When a customer calls asking about availability, you can instantly tell your AI to "block out tomorrow afternoon" 
                        without stopping work or cleaning your hands.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 mb-5">
                        <div class="text-center"><i class="bi-flag-fill fs-1 text-primary mb-3 d-block"></i></div>
                        <h3 class="h4 mb-3 text-center">Proper British Voice - Sounds Local, Not Corporate American</h3>
                        <p class="text-muted">Most AI phone systems use American voices that immediately sound wrong to UK customers. TrySpeak uses 
                        professional British voice actors (Yorkshire, London, and neutral British accents available) so your customers hear a voice 
                        that sounds local and trustworthy.</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">The voice is warm and natural, not robotic. Customers regularly don't realize they're talking to AI 
                        until we tell them. This matters for trades businesses where trust and local reputation are everything. A Leeds plumber 
                        with an American-sounding receptionist just doesn't feel right.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 mb-5">
                        <div class="text-center"><i class="bi-tools fs-1 text-primary mb-3 d-block"></i></div>
                        <h3 class="h4 mb-3 text-center">Industry-Smart AI That Knows Your Trade</h3>
                        <p class="text-muted">Generic answering services just take messages. TrySpeak's AI actually understands plumbing, electrical 
                        work, restaurant operations, and other trades. It asks the right questions: "Is water actively leaking?" for plumbers, 
                        "Is there a burning smell?" for electricians, "How many people and what time?" for restaurants.</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">The AI knows what counts as an emergency in your trade, what information you need to give a quote, 
                        and how to handle different types of customers. A plumber's emergency (burst pipe) gets an immediate text to you, 
                        while a quote request gets properly logged for you to call back during business hours.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 mb-5">
                        <div class="text-center"><i class="bi-calendar-check-fill fs-1 text-primary mb-3 d-block"></i></div>
                        <h3 class="h4 mb-3 text-center">Built-in Calendar & Booking System</h3>
                        <p class="text-muted">Your AI receptionist has access to your calendar and can book appointments directly during calls. 
                        Customers hear "I can fit you in Tuesday at 2pm or Wednesday morning - which works better?" The booking is instantly 
                        confirmed and you get an SMS notification.</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">The built-in calendar is included in your £75/month. If you want to sync with Google Calendar or 
                        Apple Calendar (so bookings appear in your existing calendar app), that's an optional £10/month add-on. Either way, 
                        you'll never miss an appointment or double-book again.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 mb-5">

                        <h3 class="h4 mb-3 text-center">Smart Dashboard With Business Analytics</h3>
                        <p class="text-muted">Your TrySpeak dashboard shows you exactly how your business is doing. See graphs of calls per day, 
                        emergency vs routine calls, booking conversion rates, and busiest times. This helps you spot patterns: "I get most 
                        emergency calls on Monday mornings" or "Wednesday afternoons are always quiet for bookings."</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">Every call is recorded and transcribed. Search through past calls to find "that customer who called 
                        about the boiler in Headingley" or review how your AI handled a difficult customer. Use these insights to improve your 
                        service and grow your business.</p>

                    TrySpeak is specifically designed for businesses where missing a call means losing a customer. Here's how different types 
                    of businesses use TrySpeak to capture every opportunity:
                </p>
                <div class="row justify-content-center">
                    <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6 mb-5">
                        <div class="text-center"><i class="bi-wrench fs-1 text-primary mb-3 d-block"></i></div>
                        <h4 class="text-center">Plumbers & Heating Engineers</h4>
                        <p class="text-muted">Plumbers can't answer phones while under a sink or dealing with an emergency. TrySpeak's AI handles 
                        emergency triage automatically - burst pipes, no heating, and gas leaks get you texted immediately, while routine jobs 
                        like tap replacements are logged for callback. The AI asks for property details, problem description, and urgency level.</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">For boiler servicing and bathroom refits, the AI can book appointments directly into your calendar. 
                        Leeds plumbers using TrySpeak report 40% fewer missed calls during busy periods and better emergency response times.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6 mb-5">
                        <div class="text-center"><i class="bi-lightning-charge-fill fs-1 text-primary mb-3 d-block"></i></div>
                        <h4 class="text-center">Electricians & Electrical Contractors</h4>
                        <p class="text-muted">Electrical emergencies can't wait. TrySpeak's AI knows that "smell of burning," "sparking socket," 
                        or "no power" are emergencies requiring immediate callout. The AI collects property details, describes the fault clearly, 
                        and texts you the full information so you can call back or attend immediately.</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">For rewiring quotes, new installations, or routine electrical inspections, the AI books survey 
                        appointments and collects all the information you need to provide an accurate quote. Perfect for Leeds electricians who 
                        spend their day on job sites and can't be interrupted for quote requests.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6 mb-5">
                        <div class="text-center"><i class="bi-shop fs-1 text-primary mb-3 d-block"></i></div>
                        <h4 class="text-center">Restaurants & Cafes</h4>
                        <p class="text-muted">Lunch and dinner rushes mean your staff can't answer phones. TrySpeak handles table bookings 
                        professionally: "How many people?", "What date and time?", "Any dietary requirements?" Bookings appear instantly in your 
                        system and customers get SMS confirmation.</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">The AI can answer frequently asked questions about opening hours, menu items, dietary options, 
                        and parking. Leeds restaurants using TrySpeak capture 60% more bookings during peak times when staff are too busy to 
                        answer phones. The AI never puts customers on hold or lets calls go to voicemail.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h4 class="text-center">Builders & General Contractors</h4>
                        <p class="text-muted">Builders juggle multiple job sites and can't take detailed quote requests while on a ladder. 
                        TrySpeak's AI collects comprehensive project information: property type, work required, timescale, budget range, and 
                        contact preferences. You get a detailed text summary of each quote request to review when convenient.</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">The AI can schedule site survey appointments and handle follow-up calls from existing clients. 
                        For ongoing projects, customers can leave messages about minor issues or questions that you can address during your 
                        next visit. Leeds builders report winning more quotes because they respond faster to initial enquiries.</p>
